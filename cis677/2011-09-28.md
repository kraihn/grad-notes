# Locking

----------

## Barrier Implementation

- Linear: Two-phase (suspend/release)
  - Counter init = 0
  - Incremented on each barrier() call, test on n
  - When all reach, reset counter, & broadcast (release)
- Tree (also Recursive Doubling)
  - Parallel communication with defined "partner"
  - Bit-address to identify recipient
  - Performance = O(log2(p)) where p is number of processes
- Butterfly
  - Hypercube
  - Hardware-based recursive doubling
- Local
  - Only need to synchronize with neighbors

### Heat Distribution Problem

- Finite difference (Laplace's equation)
- Temp: Avg of self + four neighbors
- Barrier:
  - Read up, down, left, right
  - compute new val
  - update
- Red-black relaxation
