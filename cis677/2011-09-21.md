# Chapter 4

----------

## Lecture

### Shared-Address Space

- Paradigm: Threads
- Concept: Path of execution
- Process: Unit of resource ownership
- Thread: Unit of work

#### Example: process, threads

##### Process

- t1: get_input()
- t2: update_state()
- t3: display()

State, Data

++ Performance ++

++ Program structure

++ Blocking

++ Portability

++ Latency hiding: asynchronous processing

#### Example: multi-threaded file server

#### Protocol

- If file in cache -> serve
- If not -> read from disk into cache and serve

### Programming Threads

## Project 2

### Background

- Central Dogma -- DNA => Proteins
- Process: nucleotides -> amino acids -> proteins
- DNA nucleotides: (4) ATCG
  - 3 nucleotides -> codon (triplet sets)
  - amino acids (20) -> sequence results in protein
  - C&G - A&T  

#### Sequence: Comparison/alignment

- Purpose:
  - Finding similarity
  - Transfer of information (structure -> function)
  - Suggest evolutionary origin
  - Organize/classify

Pattern matching

#### Similarity

- Operations:
  - insertion
  - deletion
  - substitution
- Score
  - match, +1
  - mismatch, -1
  - gap, -2

Example
    S = G  A  -  C  G  C  A  T  A  A  G
    T = G  A  T  C  G  C  A  A  A  A  G
        1  1 -2  1  1  1  1 -1  1  1  1  sum = 6
