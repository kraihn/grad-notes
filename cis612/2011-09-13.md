## Use Cases

### 1. Raise Main Sail

#### Precondition

1. At Mooring
2. Sails Down
3. Steady Wind - 10 Knots

#### Event Sequence

1. Out := Side View - Sails Down
2. Out := Top View - Attached to Mooring
3. In := Hoist main halipad
4. Out := Side View - Main raised

#### Postcondition

Main is raised

### 2. Raise Jib Sail

#### Precondition

1. At Mooring
2. Sails Down
3. Steady Wind - 10 Knots

#### Event Sequence

1. Out := Side View - Sails Down
2. Out := Top View - Attached to Mooring
3. In := Hoist jib halipad
4. Out := Side View - Jib raised

#### Postcondition

Jib is raised

### 3. Cast Off the Mooring

#### Preconditions

1. At Mooring
2. Sails Raised

#### Event Sequence

1. Out := Top View - Attached to Mooring
2. Out := Side View - Both sails raised
3. In := Drop mooring line
4. Out := Top View - Drifting downwind
5. In := Move tiller/rudder
6. Out := Top View - Fall off the wind
7. Out := Moving forward

#### Postcondition

Sailing on a boat

### 4. Fall Off the Wind

#### Precondition

On a Beat

#### Event Sequence

1. Out := Top View - Show sail position
2. In := Move rudder to leeward side
3. Out := Top View - Beat heading moves away from wind
4. In := Ease the main sheet
5. Out := Top View - Main farther out from center line
6. In := Ease leeward jib sheet
7. Out := Top View - Jib farther out

#### Postcondition

On a Reach

### 5. Heading Up into the Wind

#### Precondition

On a Reach

#### Event Sequence

1. Out := Top View - Show sail position
2. In := Move rudder to windward side
3. Out := Top View - Beat heading moves toward from wind
4. In := Haul/tighten the main sheet
5. Out := Top View - Main closer out from center line
6. In := Haul/tighten leeward jib sheet
7. Out := Top View - Jib closer out

#### Postcondition

On a Beat

### 6. Coming About

#### Precondition

On a Beat

#### Event Sequence

1. Out := Top View - On a beat
2. Out := Rear View - Maximum heel angle
3. In := Move rudder to the windward side
4. Out := Top View - Heading into wind
5. Out := Rear View - Vertical
6. In := Time passes
7. Out := Top View - On a beat (other side)
8. In := Release "old" leeward jib sheet
9. Out := Jib flops into wind
10. In := Haul "new" leeawrd jib sheet
11. Out := Jib now fills on the other side

#### Postcondition

Beat on the Other Side
